This project aims to predict the number of calories burnt by an individual during physical activity using machine learning techniques. We developed a program that utilizes key inputs such as heart rate, weight, age, and duration of activity to estimate calorie burn. To achieve this, we collected a dataset comprising multiple records with several features, and applied various machine learning models, including XGBoost, linear regression and random forest. Among these, the XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance, achieving high accuracy and low mean absolute error. The findings suggest that the XGBoost model can provide highly accurate predictions, making it a valuable tool for personalized health coaching and wellness tracking. This work adds to the growing field of using machine learning for health and fitness applications, offering significant potential for enhancing individualized fitness programs and health monitoring.

Note: The project is currently undergoing updates and we are still working on it.
